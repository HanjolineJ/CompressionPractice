# Objective:
The goal is to save storage on disks/servers while preserving fidelity, and 
to establish a benchmark across algorithms. The project will evolve from simple file 
input compression to a secure, container-aware pipeline that can integrate 
with Docker/Kubernetes for scalable deployment.

# Install native compressors, only once
# macOS
brew install gzip bzip2 xz zstd lz4

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y gzip bzip2 xz-utils zstd lz4

# See what files sizes you have 
ls -lh GameAsset.txt LargeDataset.txt sample_files.txt

# Install depencdency once
 pip install psutil
 pip install zstandard lz4

# Run script
python script.py
